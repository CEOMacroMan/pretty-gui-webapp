# Pretty GUI Webapp
Single-page demo with a glassmorphism UI featuring a scientific calculator, Latin text generator and light/dark theme.

## Features
- Top bar in corporate Applus orange.
- Responsive sidebar with calculator drawer and Latin panel.
- Scientific calculator with DEG/RAD modes, history and on-screen keyboard.
- Latin text generator with quotes or classic Lorem Ipsum.
- Light/dark theme with preference stored in localStorage.

## How to run
Open `index.html` directly in your browser or serve the folder with a static server such as `npx serve`. Deploying to GitHub Pages also works: push to GitHub and enable Pages with the `main` branch.

## Customization
Edit the CSS variable `--applus-orange` in `styles.css` to change the corporate color across the app.
